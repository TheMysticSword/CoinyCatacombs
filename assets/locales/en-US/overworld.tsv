$INTRO_1	It's a hot summer day outside. Too hot even. You have no clue as to why you even went out in such a skin-scorching weather.
$INTRO_2	You come across a building you have never seen before. The colourful sign above it says: "Coiny Catacombs - now open!".
$INTRO_3	You don't recall seeing any news about this building, nor do you recall construction work taking place here. And nobody around you seems to be bothered by it...<N><N>Where did this building come from?
$INTRO_4	Maybe you're just having a sunstroke? Who knows.<N><N>The only thing you know for sure is that going inside will save you from heat.
$INTRO_5	The door slams shut behind you. Suddenly, everything goes dark. You can't see anything...
$INTRO_6	You hear a voice come out of some sort of old speaker:<N><N>"Welcome, visitor! Today, you are astronomically lucky, as you have been chosen to take part in a live-action game OUT of this world..."
$INTRO_7	A game of luck...
$INTRO_8	... a game of risking everything...
$INTRO_9	... a game of winning BIG!...
$INTRO_10	... or losing it all...

$INTRO_14	We have some good and bad news for you then!<N><N>Here's the deal: if you win the game, you will receive your heart's desire! Yes, you're right, you'll get your very own <WISH>!<N><N>If you lose, however...
$INTRO_15	Well, let's just say, by entering this place you have agreed to let us take your soul away and turn it into a coin.<N><N>Yes, it's unfair, but that's what you've got to deal with when playing for <WISH>!
$INTRO_16	The game is on! Begin!

$INTRO_ABRIDGED_4_2	Alright! You'll get your <WISH> if you do better than our previous contestant!
$INTRO_ABRIDGED_4_3	<WISH>? Perfect! Try not to lose it all, like our last visitor.

$TRAPPED_CHEST	You have found a treasure chest. But... it's surrounded with traps!<N><N>You can flip a coin to try and open the chest, or you can ignore it and move on.<N><N>Heads: open the chest safely.<N>Tails: take <DAMAGE> damage!
